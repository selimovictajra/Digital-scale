# Embedded System for Weight Measurement and Product Pricing
This repository contains the project developed by our team of three members, aiming to create an embedded system that simulates the functionality of a scale in a supermarket.

## Project Overview
- The project focuses on utilizing a matrix keypad, weight sensors, a display, and the picoETF development system to enable users to input product information and display the corresponding product name, weight, and price on the display.

- Our scale will support user input of a product identification number through the matrix keypad. Once the user enters the number for a specific product, the weight sensor will measure the weight of the item on the scale.

- After obtaining the weight reading, the system will utilize predefined prices for the corresponding product to calculate the total price based on the weight.

- The result will be displayed on the screen, where the user can view the measured weight, calculated price, and product name.

- The embedded system will also be responsible for storing data about products and their prices.

- The picoETF development system will provide us with the necessary capabilities for data processing, sensor management, and communication with the matrix keypad and display.

## Project Goals
- Our primary goal is to create a reliable system that enables users to easily input products and obtain accurate information about their weight and price.

- We expect this project to provide a useful platform for demonstrating and understanding the fundamental principles of embedded systems, as well as their practical application in everyday situations.
